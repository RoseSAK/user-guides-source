### ITracr Admin User Guide

This guide is for Admin Users of Itracr, and covers the common tasks that an Admin might want to perform, such as adding 
new users and managing users, creating projects and tasks, and approving leave requests.

## Add New Users

There are two types of users on Itracr: internal users and supplier users. An internal user is a permanent employee of the company
(full-time or part-time). A supplier user is a contractor employed by the company for specific projects. An internal user will 
generate an invoice that is paid directly by the company, while a supplier user is generally paid via their supplier company. 
However, there is an option to generate an invoice for a supplier user.

You can add new users either via the link on the admin home page, or by clicking the Users tab on the navigation bar. 
This will take you to the Manage Users page. From here you can add a new user to Itracr by clicking either 'Add Internal User' 
or 'Add Supplier User'. You can then fill in the details for the new user, including contact details, invoicing details and hours
per day. You can also assign a manager to the user. The manager will optionally be able to approve the timecard and leave
requests of that user. Adding a supplier user requires first creating a supplier company. You can do this quickly from the 'Add 
supplier user' page. 

When you have filled in the relevant details for a new user, click the green 'Save User' button. This will take you to the edit 
user page. In order for a user to be active, you must click the link below the user email on the 'Edit User' page which says 'Invite User to ITracr'. This
send the user an email which contains a link to the registration page.

# Activate Users

By default, new users are inactive. To activate a user, you must click the link below the user email on the 'Edit User' page, 
which says 'Invite User to Itracr'. When you create and save a new user, you will be taken straight to this page, so you can 
activate users immediately after creating them. Alternatively, you can create users and activate them at a later date. You can 
access the 'Edit User' page for a particular user by navigating to the 'Manage Users' page, clicking on the name of the user, and
clicking on the 'Edit User' button in the top right-hand corner. You will then be able to activate this user, if they are inactive, 
and deactivate them if they are active. 

When a user is activated, they will receive an email containing a link to a registration page. Their username will be the email 
which you entered for them, and they will create their own password. Having done this, they will be able to log in to ITracr to 
fill in their timecard and make leave requests. Their status will appear as 'Active'. 

## Add a Supplier 

If you do not employ contractors, you can skip this step.

Click on the 'Manage Suppliers' option in the Users tab of the navigation bar. This will take you to a list of your
current suppliers. You can add a new supplier by clicking the 'Add Supplier' button in the top right of the page, or amend the 
details for an existing supplier by clicking on their name. 

## Add a Client

A client can be an external company, or a department within your own company. Every project that is created must be assigned to
a client. You can create new clents via the Clients page, which is accessed either from the Admin Dashboard or the navigation bar.
The Clients page presents a list of all your current clients. Click the button in the top right-hand corner to add a new client. 

There is an option to make the client internal, in which case you can use the company address. Once a client is created and 
saved, you are taken to the Client Info page. Here, you can add new projects and tasks for the client. 

## Create a Project

Projects can be managed via the 'Projects' tab on the navigation bar. 

## Create Tasks for a Project

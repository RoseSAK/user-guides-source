### ITracr Admin User Guide

This guide is for Admin Users of Itracr, and covers the common tasks that an Admin might want to perform, such as adding 
new users and managing users, creating projects and tasks, and approving leave requests.

## Add New Users

There are two types of users on Itracr: internal users and supplier users. An internal user is a permanent employee of the company
(full-time or part-time). A supplier user is a contractor employed by the company for specific projects. An internal user will 
generate an invoice that is paid directly by the company, while a supplier user is generally paid via their supplier company. 
However, there is an option to generate an invoice for a supplier user.

You can add new users either via the link on the admin home page, or by clicking the Users tab on the navigation bar. 
This will take you to the Manage Users page. From here you can add a new user to Itracr by clicking either 'Add Internal User' 
or 'Add Supplier User'. You can then fill in the details for the new user, including contact details, invoicing details and hours
per day. You can also assign a manager to the user. The manager will optionally be able to approve the timecard and leave
requests of that user. Adding a supplier user requires first creating a supplier company. You can do this quickly from the 'Add 
supplier user' page. 

When you have filled in the relevant details for a new user, click the green 'Save User' button. This will take you to the
'Manage Users' page where you can view a list of all users. 

## Add a Supplier 

If you do not employ contractors, you can skip this step.

There is a 'Manage Suppliers' option on the Users tab of the navigation bar. Clicking on this will take you to a list of your
current suppliers. You can add a new supplier by clicking the 'Add Supplier' button in the top right of the page, or amend the 
for an existing supplier by clicking on their name.
